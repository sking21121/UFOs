### UFOs

## Overview of Project
The initial UFO webpage is working. A user can input a date and receive a filtered search, but Dana wants more search criterias. 
Sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same 
time. The purpose of this project is to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. I will be using Javascript
and html to modify search criterias.

## Results
The webpage has a title and an opening analysis of UFOs sightings. There is a table full a data below the opening paragraph. And 
on the left side of the table is the search criterias.

The search filters are the five boxes with prepopulated text to show the user the type of text to input for a search to work. The user
may search one or more filters to further narrow their search.

A user may input one criteria, then press enter key on the keyboard to filter the search. With the results from the previous search
and user may enter another search criteria without clearing the table and starting over. To clear the search filters the user needs 
to click on the "UFO Sightings" text in the upper left corner of the page to reset the results.
